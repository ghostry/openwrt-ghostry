OpenDPI module README
---------------------

This package is a GPL implementation of an iptables and netfilter module for
OpenDPI integration into the Linux kernel.

The prerequisites are:

- OpenDPI source package 

- Linux sources (it's been tested for versions 2.6.26 and 2.6.34)

- Iptables header files (called "iptables-dev" in Debian distributions, it's
  been tested for version 1.4.2)


Compiled kernel features
------------------------

In order to use OpenDPI as a kernel module notice that:

- You should ENABLE Netfilter conntrack events (and also enable Advanced
  netfilter features to see it).

In kernel 2.6.34 its defined as:

Connection tracking events
Symbol: NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS
Location:
-> Networking support
 -> Networking options
  -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)
   -> Core Netfilter Configuration
    -> Netfilter connection tracking support

- If your kernel version is 2.6.31 or greater, then you should DISABLE
  Netfilter conntrack for the Netlink protocol.

In kernel 2.6.34 its defined as:

Connection tracking netlink interface
Symbol: NF_CT_NETLINK
Location:
-> Networking support
 -> Networking options
  -> Network packet filtering framework (Netfilter)
   -> Core Netfilter Configuration
    -> Netfilter connection tracking support


Once you have downloaded/installed each package and checked for the above
kernel features you can read the INSTALL file.
