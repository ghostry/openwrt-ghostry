config MTD_BRCMNAND

	default n
	depends on MTD
	help
	  This enables support for accessing selected types of NAND flash
	  devices through the Broadcom NAND controller.

config MTD_BRCMNAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify Broadcom NAND page writes"
	default n
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  Broadcom NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

config MTD_BRCMNAND_CORRECTABLE_ERR_HANDLING
	bool "Refresh a block on a one bit correctable ECC error"
	default y
	depends on MTD_BRCMNAND
	help
	  If there is a 1-bit correctable error detected during NAND flash read, the
	  Broadcom NAND flash driver can refresh the corresponding NAND flash block.
	  Refreshing implies a sequence of read->erase->write. Refreshing the block
	  drastically reduces the probability of occurance of a similar (correctable)
	  error.
