Source: debootstrap-udeb_1.0.30_all.udeb
Type: ipkg
Description:  debootstrap is used to create a Debian base system from scratch, without
 requiring the availability of dpkg or apt. It does this by downloading .deb
 files from a mirror site, and carefully unpacking them into a directory which
 can eventually be chrooted into.
