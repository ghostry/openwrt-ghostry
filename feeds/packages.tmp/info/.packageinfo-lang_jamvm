Source: jamvm-1.5.4.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  JamVM is a new Java Virtual Machine which conforms to the JVM 
 specification version (blue book). In comparison to most other VM's (free 
 and commercial) it is extremely small.However, unlike other small VMs 
 (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and includes 
 support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References, the Java 
 Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API.
