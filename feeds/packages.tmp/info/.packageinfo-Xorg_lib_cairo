Description: Cairo is a 2D graphics library. The cairo API provides operations similar
to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo
include stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and
compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All
drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation
(scale, rotation, shear, etc.).
