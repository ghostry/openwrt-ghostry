Title: implementation of the rolling-checksum algorithm
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: librsync-0.9.7.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	librsync implements the rolling-checksum algorithm of remote file
	synchronization that was popularized by the rsync utility and is
	used in rproxy. This algorithm transfers the differences between 2
	files without needing both files on the same system.
