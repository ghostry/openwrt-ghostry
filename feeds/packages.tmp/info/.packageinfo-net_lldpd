Description: 	LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is an industry standard protocol designed 
	to supplant proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as 
	Extreme's EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol) and 
	CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol). 
	The goal of LLDP is to provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver 
	Link-Layer notifications to adjacent network devices.
