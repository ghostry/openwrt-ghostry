Type: ipkg
Description: mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-
milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh
derivate currently being actively developed.  It includes bug
fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
mksh has UTF-8 support (e.g. in the emacs editing mode); R38c
corresponds to OpenBSD 4.5-current ksh (without GNU bash-like
S1 and fancy character classes).  The code has throughoutly
been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli-
ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi-
lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own)
have been placed.
